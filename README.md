# LoadingAnimations
Some web loading animations effect I wrote via using HTML/CSS + JQuery

### demo1
this demo shows how to set the loading animations with a specific time (3s in my example).

note
: this is not the best practice, but for some case it's handy.

### demo2

this demo shows how the loading animations faded out as soon as the web page is rendered.  It's more pratical than demo1 because it's not set by time.
